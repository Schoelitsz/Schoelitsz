- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Schoelitsz, Terri!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in artifiial intelligence, software engineering and security
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning java and javascript, PHP and trying to deepen my understanding of the MySQL platform

I know a decent amount of C# and python. My goal is to become an a.i. engineer. To reach this goal, I have a list of skills to improve, starting with some front-end 
and back-end skills, specifically database to improve my data management. Once fully grown in my role as full-stack/software engineering, I'll make steps towards data 
engineering.
