Hello,
My Github is kind of a mess right now, but it'll all make sense in the future. 
See, I am so allover the place because I want to achieve so much to do my part for a better world. Most people see technology and a natural world as polar opposites, 
but I see them as two elements that could not only co-exist, but be enhanced by one another. I believe in prioritizing the environment, so why do I surround myself with tech?
Because, e-readers, tablets and an efficient way to working with foldable tech can replace paper as a resource, as an example.

So, what does any of this have to do with what I'm doing?
Ok, so I'm freshly graduated, I'm a noobie in the software engineering work. I'm at the absolute bottom of the foodchain -- and ready to work my way up. For now I'm a
C# developer, but I want to grow in the worth of algorythm and a.i., game development (more for fun) and creating things that genuinely make a difference, one way or another.

And that is a long, complicated journey, one that will fulfill me, even if I never make it to the end.
Do you want to follow along?

Love, Terri.
